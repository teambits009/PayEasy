# 💸 PayEasy - Backend Logic

A one-stop backend service powering **PayEasy**, a fast, secure, and seamless payment system that allows users to make payments as easily as sending a message. This repository contains the server-side logic that handles user authentication, transaction processing, wallet management, and third-party integrations.

---

## ⚙️ What is PayEasy?

**PayEasy** is a simple, intuitive payment solution that enables:
- Instant money transfers between users
- QR code and link-based payments
- Wallet funding via bank or card
- Payment request handling
- Merchant checkout integrations

Backend features are optimized for real-time performance, data security, and extensibility.

---

## 🧩 Key Backend Features

- 🔐 Secure user authentication & JWT token management
- 🏦 Multi-wallet system with transaction history
- ⚡ Instant P2P payments and payment requests
- 🧾 Webhook-ready merchant API
- 🧠 Fraud detection & rate limiting
- 🔁 Integration with payment providers (e.g., Stripe, Paystack)
- 📈 Analytics and reporting module (optional)

## 🏗️ Technical Design

### 1. Architecture Overview

```
Client App (Mobile/Web)
    ↓
FastAPI Backend (REST API)
    ↓
Business Logic Layer (Services)
    ↓
Database (PostgreSQL)      Payment Providers (e.g. Stripe)
        ↓                           ↓
      Redis (Queue for async jobs, rate limits)
```

### 2. Core Modules

- **Auth Module**: OAuth2 & JWT-based user authentication.
- **Wallet Module**: Multi-wallet support with balance tracking, transaction logs.
- **Transaction Engine**: Handles validations, debits/credits, rollback on failure.
- **Payout Processor**: Sends funds to bank or card via external payment APIs.
- **Webhook Listener**: Accepts callbacks from payment gateways for status updates.
- **Background Jobs**: Celery workers process scheduled/async tasks (e.g. email, retry payments).

### 3. Data Flow (e.g., Send Money)

1. User initiates payment request via `/wallet/transfer`
2. Auth middleware validates user token
3. Request is routed to `TransferService`
4. Internal checks (balance, limits, fraud detection)
5. Transaction is committed to DB
6. Recipient wallet is credited
7. Notification is triggered (push/email/SMS)

### 4. Security Practices

- HTTPS-only communication
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (Redis)
- CSRF protection on public APIs
- Scoped access tokens for third-party clients
- Encrypted credentials & secrets

### 5. Scalability

- Stateless API (horizontal scaling via Docker + Kubernetes)
- Async task processing via Celery and Redis
- Modular microservice-ready architecture
